        <p>During my IBM internship, I sat in on a workshop with a major financial institution that wanted to explore IBM's generative AI solutions. Many problems and ideas were shared, but one in particular stood out to me: how could generative AI help people who have questions about complex and personal financial situations?</p>

                                <p>I considered making the create goal modal be a right sidebar instead, but after making that layout I realized that having a right sidebar along with the left sidebar made the interface too crowded. A right sidebar was also unnecessary because the user wouldn't be interacting with the content in the sidebar and the chatbot at the same time. I made this into a modal to help the user focus on the current task of tweaking the goal that they chose.</p>
