            <p>During my IBM internship, I sat in on a workshop with a major financial institution that wanted to explore IBM's generative AI solutions.

A right sidebar was also unnecessary because the user wouldn't be interacting with the content in the sidebar and the chatbot at the same time.

                            <p>A mentor encouraged me to consider not only the user value, but also the business value.<br><br>As a result, I started to think about this project in terms of how improving the financial planning experience of a bank's account holders will ultimately help the bank build customer loyalty and promote bank services.</p>

                            <p>By using IBM's design system, Carbon, for this project, I learned best practices for designing experiences using an existing design system. At first, I tended to detach components a lot, which is not the best practice.<br><br>As the project went on, I learned the importance of using the existing components properly in order to make the development process smoother and to keep consistency in the design.</p>

                                While the other designers and I did our best to design an interface using best design system practices, we had to significantly narrow the scope of the final developed prototype that we submitted for the hackathon.<br><br>Despite this, our design thinking process allowed us to still develop a prototype that can meet user and business needs.
