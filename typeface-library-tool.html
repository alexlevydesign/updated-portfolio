            <p>I know from personal experience that finding the perfect typeface for a project can be difficult and time-consuming. In addition to combing through pages of different typefaces, designers often have to constantly switch between the typeface library and their design software to test how different typefaces look in the context of their project. Other designers I spoke with shared this sentiment, so I decided to redesign and improve the experience of searching for typefaces.</p>

                            1. Some designers choose typefaces based on &quot;vibes&quot;, while others do in-depth research.

                            2. Designers with more experience are more likely to have extensive personal typeface collections organized in a professional typeface library application with tags.

                            3. Newer designers sometimes feel frustrated when looking for typefaces — even when using services such as Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts.

                            4. Designers have to sift through hundreds of different typefaces, comparing factors from the overall personality to the minute details of a specific glyph.
                            
                            5. Designers like to look at typefaces in the context of how it will be used, such as in a logo, headings on a website, or body copy on a brochure.">

                                    <p>After looking at the existing typeface library websites, there were some features that I thought might improve usability based on my research and user interviews, such as:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>More granular and specific filters that give correct and consistent results as well as fewer subjective filters, such as a filter for "fun" typefaces. This would give a designer more fine-tuned control over their results.</li>
                                        <li>Options to filter for typefaces suited to particular mediums and types of design work.</li>
                                        <li>A way to control the settings for how the sample text is displayed (e.g. the line height, the weight, etc.) to allow a designer to quickly see if a certain typeface works in the context that they need.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>When I tested this interface with a user, she said that it was a little cramped, and would rather have more room for the typefaces themselves. Based on that feedback, I removed the right sidebar and added a switch to the left sidebar that would display the content formerly on the right.</p>

                                <p>Since one of the biggest factors in the typeface a designer chooses is the type of design work they are doing, I added that to the filters to help designers narrow down their search.</p>

                                    <p>The designer I tested with said that, while she liked the idea of being able to easily find typefaces that are good for specific types of design work, she wondered what would happen if she selected a filter in the "design work" section that logically wouldn't make sense alongside a selected filter in another section.</p>

                                    <p>Instead of having the type of design work as a single filter, I implemented presets for specific combinations of filters. This would make it easier for a designer to quickly find typefaces suited for certain types of design work while ensuring that the user doesn't get zero search results since the filters are predefined.</p>

A right sidebar was also unnecessary because the user wouldn't be interacting with the content in the sidebar and the chatbot at the same time.
